*Why the Git LFS Files Are Corrupted if you download the zip from GitHub<*:

*The files that were stored using Git LFS (Large File Storage) have become corrupted due to some issues with how the LFS system handles large binary files.
In some cases, when files are not properly pushed or retrieved using Git LFS, they can become broken or corrupted. This often happens if the LFS tracking was not properly set up or if the LFS files were not correctly synchronized between the local and remote repositories.
By using the provided download link and manually replacing the JBlackJackRes folder, we can bypass these issues and ensure you have access to the correct, uncorrupted resource files.
This should help you get the resources set up and explain the Git LFS problem! Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly from the command line.*
